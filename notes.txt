** Using AWS SES for sending emails has a bit of complications --->

i. Sender email ID and receiver email id should be both verified at development stage.
ii. In production environment, the AWS account should be moved out of AWS Sandbox https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html

this is done to prevent email spamming. Once out of Sandbox we can send emails to unverified addresses with a verified email address.
